ConnectU is a modern web app built with React that makes it easy to create fast, data-driven applications.

## Built with: HTML, React, TypeScript & JavaScript, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Node.js

## Project structure
- `app/` – Main app code (pages, components, styles, data loading)
- `public/` – Static files like icons or images
- `package.json` – List of dependencies and scripts you can run
- `vite.config.ts` / `react-router.config.ts` – Build and routing settings (you usually don’t need to touch these at first)

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the app in development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open your browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost:5173`
   
## Useful commands
- `npm run dev` – Start the app for development 
- `npm run build` – Create an optimized production build
- `npm run start` – Run the built app with Node
- `npm run typecheck` – Check the code for TypeScript errors

## Building for production
To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates a `build/` folder with everything needed to deploy the app.

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Built with ❤️ using React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML and TypeScript.
